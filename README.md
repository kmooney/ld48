# Where to start

Things are a bit confused since i haven't made the "core" part a real library yet.. soo

* app/game.js is where everything gets bolted together
* app/index.jsx is where the React container kicks off
* Generally, game specific components are in app/ , and generalized stuff is in src/core/
